-   The view to see the details of the sakes shows in particular the main characteristics of the scanned bottle, a note and a description.
    
-  It is also possible to search for a sake without scanning it by several paths:
    

-   Thematic research: Search by type of sake, there are four main categories of Sake: Junmai-shu, Ginjô-shu, Honjōzō-shu, Daiginjō-shu. Clicking on a sake from the present list takes you to a details page.
    
-   Search by association: It is also possible, according to the same principle, to search for Sake associated with certain types of food (Fish, Meat, Vegetable, Aperitifs).
    
-   Personalized search: Search by text on the title of Sake associated with a sorting by fields (types, brand, tastes, alcohol level).
    

-   Finally, the application has an Account tab allowing you to create an account in a secure manner. A registration confirmation is sent to the user by email. You can also log in (which displays the user's first name in the navigation bar at the top right) or reset their password by email.
